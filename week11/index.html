            <h3>MDN: Validating Forms</h3>
            <p>Client-side form validation helps ensure data submitted meets the requirements set in the form controls before the data is submit to the server. This is important to ensure a good user experience. Form validation are, required fields and specific data format like phone numbers and emails. The client side gives will not submit until the requirements are met.<br>
                Types of validation are Built-in form validation, used in HTML5 form validation features, requirements are set in the HTML. Has better performance but is not as customizable. JavaScript validation is coding you create so is very customizable.<br>
                Built in form validations has the fields, required: must be filled before submitted, minlength and maxlength:min and max length of text data, min and max: min and max length of numeric data, type: whether data needs to be a number, email, or other type of data, pattern:defines a pattern the data needs to follow. CSS pseudo classes exist for the form elements :valid and :invalid.<br>
                Javascript validation helps when you want control over native error messages or need to work with browsers not supporting built-in form validation.
