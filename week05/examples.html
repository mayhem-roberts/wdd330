        'use strict'; // strict mode

        pi = 3.142; // strict mode example: pi is not defined
        /* 
        Strict mode gives more exceptions and warnings, must be put at the top of the script
        can also be added to a function so it only effects whatever is inside.
        gives more detail to what is wrong.

        Debugging inthe browser, use break point to run through parts of the code. Helpful because
        the bug does not usually originate at the error.
